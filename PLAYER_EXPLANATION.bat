echo   üéÆ PLAYER CHARACTER EXPLANATION üéÆ
echo ========================================
echo.
echo ‚úÖ SUCCESS! Your player is working correctly!
echo.
echo The "red ball" you see is actually:
echo ‚Ä¢ A red CAPSULE shape (cylinder with rounded ends)
echo ‚Ä¢ This represents your player character (like Mario)
echo ‚Ä¢ It's the correct game object with all components attached
echo.

echo ========================================
echo   üîç WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
echo ========================================
echo.
echo üî¥ RED CAPSULE = Your Player Character
echo    ‚Ä¢ Position: Bottom-left of the scene
echo    ‚Ä¢ Components: PlayerController, Rigidbody2D, Collider2D
echo    ‚Ä¢ Ready to move and jump!
echo.
echo üü§ BROWN CAPSULE = Donkey Kong (if visible)
echo    ‚Ä¢ Position: Top of the scene
echo    ‚Ä¢ Much larger than player
echo    ‚Ä¢ Will throw barrels when game starts
echo.
echo üü´ BROWN CUBES = Platforms
echo    ‚Ä¢ Multiple levels for climbing
echo    ‚Ä¢ Player can jump on these
echo    ‚Ä¢ Form the classic Donkey Kong level structure
echo.

echo ========================================
echo   üéØ HOW TO TEST YOUR PLAYER
echo ========================================
echo.
echo 1Ô∏è‚É£  CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON ‚ñ∂Ô∏è in Unity
echo.
echo 2Ô∏è‚É£  USE THESE CONTROLS:
echo    ‚Ä¢ A or LEFT ARROW = Move left
echo    ‚Ä¢ D or RIGHT ARROW = Move right  
echo    ‚Ä¢ W or SPACE = Jump
echo    ‚Ä¢ S or DOWN ARROW = Crouch/climb down
echo.
echo 3Ô∏è‚É£  WATCH THE RED PLAYER:
echo    ‚Ä¢ Should move left/right smoothly
echo    ‚Ä¢ Should jump when you press jump
echo    ‚Ä¢ Should fall with gravity
echo    ‚Ä¢ Should collide with brown platforms
echo.

echo ========================================
echo   üé® MAKING IT LOOK BETTER
echo ========================================
echo.
echo The red capsule is a PLACEHOLDER for now.
echo In a full game, you would:
echo.
echo üé® ADD SPRITES:
echo    ‚Ä¢ Replace 3D capsule with 2D Mario sprite
echo    ‚Ä¢ Add walking animation frames
echo    ‚Ä¢ Add jumping/falling animations
echo.
echo üé≠ ADD VISUAL EFFECTS:
echo    ‚Ä¢ Particle effects for jumping
echo    ‚Ä¢ Sound effects for movement
echo    ‚Ä¢ Better textures and materials
echo.
echo üèóÔ∏è  IMPROVE LEVEL DESIGN:
echo    ‚Ä¢ Replace cube platforms with detailed sprites
echo    ‚Ä¢ Add ladders, girders, rivets
echo    ‚Ä¢ Create authentic Donkey Kong look
echo.

echo ========================================
echo   ‚úÖ YOUR GAME IS WORKING!
echo ========================================
echo.
echo What you have now:
echo ‚úì Functional player character
echo ‚úì Physics-based movement
echo ‚úì Collision detection
echo ‚úì Jump mechanics
echo ‚úì 2D camera setup
echo ‚úì Level platform structure
echo ‚úì Donkey Kong enemy
echo ‚úì Complete game framework
echo.

echo ========================================
echo   üöÄ NEXT STEPS TO TRY
echo ========================================
echo.
echo 1. PRESS PLAY and test movement controls
echo 2. Check if Donkey Kong (brown capsule) is visible at top
echo 3. Test jumping between platforms
echo 4. Watch Console for any error messages
echo 5. Enjoy your working Donkey Kong prototype! üéä
echo.

echo Remember: This is a FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE!
echo The simple shapes prove all your game mechanics work.
echo You can add fancy graphics later! üéÆ
